Visual studio solution (run debugx86) tested on Windows 10

Q1
----------
* Control points can be repositioned by clicking and dragging them
* Click elsewhere to add a new point
* Space bar changes the type of curve


Q2
----------
* View is animated same as in the examples, use mouse buttons to change axis of rotation
* Space bar shows/hides the control points
* Implementation is really inefficient (points computed each update) but was smooth enough on my laptop
